 *
 * User input (screen fields, flow input variables) is tracked through the flow's
 * data-flow graph. A violation is raised when that data:
 *  - reaches a database operation in a flow running in System Mode Without
 *    Sharing (the query/DML bypasses sharing using user-influenced values), or
 *  - is passed into a subflow that itself runs without sharing.
